This repo was made to support our AERO 401/402 Design project.

Our project consists of creating a satellite constellation that uses SAR "imaging" techniques to create 3d models of ground targets.
Our constellation must capture various angles of each group target ranging from Azimuth (0-360) and Elevation (0-90) by 10 degree increments. This gives us a total of 324 bins that much be filled for each target. Our project will create a constellation by trading the total amount of time to image the ground targets with the cost of the constellation (mainly driven by number of satellites).
